    "## Data structures and syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic\n",
    "- Logical: bool\n",
    "- Numeric: int, float, complex\n",
    "- Sequence: list, tuple, range\n",
    "- Text sequence: str\n",
    "- Map: dict\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Integers\n",
    "Integers are numbers with no decimal parts, such as -5, -4, -1, 0, 7, 10, 100, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "To declare an integer in Python, simply write `variable_name = initial value`\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "`user_age = 20`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Float\n",
    "Float refers to numbers that have decimal parts, such as 1.234, -3.543, 12.01, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "To declare a float in Python, simply write `variable_name = initial value`\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "`user_height = 1.82`, `user_weight = 85.2` **OR** `user_height, user_weight = 1.82, 85.2`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### String\n",
    "String refers to text\n",
    "\n",
    "To declare a string, you can either use `variable_name = 'initial value'` (single quotes) **OR** `variable_name = \"initial value\"` (double quotes)\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "`user_name = 'Alan'` `user_surname = \"Turing\"` `user_age = '30'`\n",
    "\n",
    "**NB** Because we wrote `user_age = '30'`, `user_age` is a string. In contrast, if we wrote `user_age = 30` (no quotes), `user_age` would be an integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Built-in String Functions\n",
    "Python includes a number of built-in functions to manipulate strings. An example of a function available in Python is the `upper()` method for strings. It can be used to capitalize all the letters in a string. For instance, `'Alan'.upper()` will give us the string `'ALAN'`. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Type Casting in Python\n",
    "Sometimes it is necessary to convert from one type to another, such as from an `int` to a `str` or from `str` to `int`\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three built-in functions in Python that allow us to do type casting. These are the `int()`, `float()`, and `str()` functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `int()` function takes in a float or a string and converts it to an integer. To change a float to an integer, we can type `int(5.71234)`. We'll get 5 as a result (anything after the decimal point is removed). To change a string to an integer, we can type `int(\"4\")` and we'll get 4. However, we cannot type `int(\"Hello\")` or `int('4.258746)`. We will get an error in both cases."
